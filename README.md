## General Info
React Gamelist is a basic React application to showcase my understanding on how to build an application incorporating a number of several React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useReducer and also state manager: Context API. Moreover, there are a few more packages involved in this project as well which are React Router and Styled Component.<br/>
Since this is a pure front-end project, there won't be any backend and the data will be stored in the local storage in you browser.
The data in this project is derived from Free-to-game API (please head over to https://rapidapi.com/digiwalls/api/free-to-play-games-database/details for more info about the API.)
